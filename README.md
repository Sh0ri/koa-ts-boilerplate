# Boilerplate for Koa, TypeScript and tagged ES6 template literals for server side templates

Just some testing on a server rendered views with Koa, TypeScript and hyperx for server side rendered ES6 template literals for templating.. I don't really know if this is useful.

If you want to try it, first install [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) and then run:

```
ts-node src/server.ts
```
