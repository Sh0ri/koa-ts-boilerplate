# [WIP] Boilerplate for Koa, TypeScript and Template literals

Just some testing on a server rendered views with Koa, TypeScript and hyperx.

I don't really know if this is useful.

If you want to try it, first install [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) and then run:

```
ts-node src/server.ts
```
